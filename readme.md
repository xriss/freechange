in order of preference we should try



IMF : Daily

we can cycle through each month and get rather messy daily numbers from here

FRED : Daily


from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/94

available USD to XXX or XXX to USD feeds are

DEXUSEU,DEXKOUS,DEXMXUS,DEXUSAL,DEXBZUS,DEXINUS,DEXSZUS,DEXJPUS,DEXVZUS,DEXTHUS,DTWEXO,DEXSFUS,DEXTAUS,DEXMAUS,DEXHKUS,DEXSDUS,DEXNOUS,DEXSIUS,DEXUSNZ,DEXDNUS,DEXSLUS,DEXCHUS,DEXUSUK,DEXCAUS,

FYI that DEX is Daily Exchange and can also be changed to EX for 
monthly or YEX for yearly and the characters following are 
abbreviations for a country ( country codes? ) and US for USD, 
sometimes it is too USD sometimes it is from USD depending on where the 
US is placed


and the full series of DEXUSEU so that would be USD to EUR can be grabbed with
